## Introduction
Teamwork is an essential part of every project. Trust me, this is more important than writing lines of code. You won't really notice it that much when you're on a small project. But imagine what it would be like if we worked with a team of dozens or hundreds of people participating?

That's why we need to create common principles, processes, and regulations to have the most harmonious development team. Below is the information I have drawn from my own experience combined with the shares of famous programmers that I have collected. It may not be exactly right for your project, but it is a basic framework that you can apply to your project.

### How a team should work together?
I just wanted to make a video to give people who work solo or or on a smaller project more insight into a larger scale project.  Your mileage may very.  Every company does things their own way from what Iâ€™ve seen, and most companies have various teams that all work on their own sub systems and integrate with others.
